### Hi there! I'm Maanav Nair ✌️

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm currently a sophomore in college, deeply immersed in the captivating world of web development. With a good grasp of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and my current focus on learning React, I'm passionate about building robust web applications.

Driven by my love for open source and the boundless possibilities of web development, I'm constantly seeking to expand my skill set and explore new technologies. I firmly believe in the power of collaboration and actively contribute to open source projects whenever possible.

I'm thrilled to connect with like-minded individuals, collaborate on exciting projects, and continue my journey as a web developer. Feel free to explore my repositories, provide feedback, or reach out to me for any opportunities or discussions. Let's build amazing things together!
